- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

## Configuration

The application connects to Solana mainnet by default. You can modify the RPC endpoints in `src/hooks/useSolanaWebSocket.ts`:

```typescript
const SOLANA_RPC_URL = 'https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com';
const SOLANA_WS_URL = 'wss://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com';
```

## Price Feed Data

The application uses the `pyth_lazer_list.json` file which contains metadata for all available price feeds. Each feed includes:

- Feed ID and name
- Symbol and description
- Exponent for price formatting
- CoinMarketCap ID
- Update frequency and channel information

## Account Derivation

Price feed accounts are derived using:
```typescript
const feedAddress = PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync(
  [
    Buffer.from('price_feed'),
    Buffer.from('stork-oracle'),
    Buffer.from(feedName)
  ],
  PROGRAM_ID
)[0];
```

Where `PROGRAM_ID` is `PriCems5tHihc6UDXDjzjeawomAwBduWMGAi8ZUjppd`.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **WebSocket Connection Errors**: Check your internet connection and ensure you're not behind a restrictive firewall
2. **Price Data Not Loading**: Some feeds may not be active or available. Try selecting a different cryptocurrency
3. **Build Errors**: Make sure all dependencies are installed with `npm install`

### Browser Compatibility

The application works best with modern browsers that support:
- ES2020 features
- WebSocket connections
- CSS backdrop-filter
